# Guess-The-Number
This Python program implements a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 50. The game has two difficulty levels: easy and hard, with 10 and 5 attempts respectively.

Features:
- Randomly generated number between 1 and 50
- Two difficulty levels: easy (10 attempts) and hard (5 attempts)
- User input for guessing the number
- Feedback for high or low guesses
- Win or lose conditions

How it works:
1. The program prints a logo and introduces the game.
2. The program thinks of a random number between 1 and 50.
3. The user chooses a difficulty level (easy or hard).
4. The program sets the number of attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.
5. The user guesses a number, and the program checks if it's high, low, or correct.
6. If the guess is incorrect, the program reduces the number of attempts and prompts the user to guess again.
7. If the user runs out of attempts, they lose. If they guess correctly, they win.
This code demonstrates basic Python concepts such as random number generation, conditional statements, loops, and functions.
